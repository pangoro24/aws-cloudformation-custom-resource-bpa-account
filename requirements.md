# Requirements Document

## Introduction

Este documento define los requisitos para un CloudFormation Custom Resource que habilita S3 Block Public Access a nivel de cuenta de AWS. El custom resource garantiza que todas las configuraciones de acceso público estén bloqueadas para prevenir exposición accidental de datos, cumpliendo con las mejores prácticas de seguridad de AWS.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Account-Level Public Access Block Configuration

**User Story:** As a security engineer, I want the AWS account to have S3 Block Public Access (BPA) enabled at the account level to prevent accidental data exposure across all S3 buckets in the account.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the Custom Resource is created THEN the system SHALL enable all four BPA settings: BlockPublicAcls=true, IgnorePublicAcls=true, BlockPublicPolicy=true, RestrictPublicBuckets=true
2. WHEN the Custom Resource is updated THEN the system SHALL apply the new BPA configuration as specified in the CloudFormation template
3. WHEN BPA settings are already configured THEN the system SHALL update them to match the desired state (ensuring idempotency)
4. WHEN the Custom Resource is deleted THEN the system SHALL optionally disable BPA settings based on a configurable parameter
5. IF the account lacks permissions to modify BPA settings THEN the system SHALL return a FAILED status with descriptive error message

### Requirement 2: CloudFormation Integration and Lifecycle Management

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want the Custom Resource to integrate seamlessly with CloudFormation stack operations and provide proper lifecycle management.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN CloudFormation sends a CREATE request THEN the Lambda SHALL process the request and return SUCCESS or FAILED status within 15 minutes
2. WHEN CloudFormation sends an UPDATE request THEN the Lambda SHALL compare current and desired states and apply changes if needed
3. WHEN CloudFormation sends a DELETE request THEN the Lambda SHALL handle cleanup based on the RetainOnDelete parameter
4. WHEN any operation fails THEN the Lambda SHALL send a FAILED response with detailed error information to CloudFormation
5. WHEN the Lambda function times out THEN CloudFormation SHALL receive a FAILED response to prevent stack inconsistencies
6. WHEN the Custom Resource receives invalid properties THEN the system SHALL validate inputs and return FAILED status with validation errors

### Requirement 3: Security and Access Control

**User Story:** As a security architect, I want the Custom Resource to operate with minimal required privileges and secure execution context.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the Lambda executes THEN the system SHALL use an IAM role with only s3:PutAccountPublicAccessBlock and s3:GetAccountPublicAccessBlock permissions
2. WHEN the Lambda is invoked THEN the system SHALL verify the request originates from CloudFormation service
3. WHEN the Lambda processes requests THEN the system SHALL log all operations to CloudWatch with appropriate log levels
4. WHEN sensitive data is logged THEN the system SHALL mask or exclude sensitive information from logs
5. IF the Lambda role lacks required permissions THEN the system SHALL return FAILED status with permission-related error message

### Requirement 4: Monitoring and Observability

**User Story:** As a platform engineer, I want comprehensive monitoring and alerting for the Custom Resource operations to ensure reliability and quick issue resolution.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the Lambda executes THEN the system SHALL emit CloudWatch metrics for success/failure rates and execution duration
2. WHEN operations fail THEN the system SHALL publish detailed error information to CloudWatch Logs
3. WHEN BPA configuration changes THEN the system SHALL optionally send notifications via SNS topic if configured
4. WHEN the Lambda encounters errors THEN the system SHALL create structured log entries with error codes and context
5. WHEN monitoring is enabled THEN the system SHALL provide metrics for tracking compliance drift

### Requirement 5: Configuration Flexibility and Validation

**User Story:** As a cloud architect, I want configurable BPA settings and proper validation to support different security requirements across environments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the Custom Resource is deployed THEN the system SHALL accept individual BPA setting overrides via CloudFormation properties
2. WHEN properties are provided THEN the system SHALL validate that BPA settings are boolean values
3. WHEN RetainOnDelete is specified THEN the system SHALL preserve BPA settings during stack deletion if set to true
4. WHEN NotificationTopicArn is provided THEN the system SHALL validate the SNS topic exists and is accessible
5. IF invalid configuration is provided THEN the system SHALL return FAILED status with specific validation error messages

### Requirement 6: Audit and Compliance Reporting

**User Story:** As a compliance officer, I want detailed audit trails and current state reporting for S3 Block Public Access configurations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN operations complete successfully THEN the system SHALL return current BPA settings in the CloudFormation response data
2. WHEN the Custom Resource executes THEN the system SHALL log the previous and new BPA states for audit purposes
3. WHEN compliance reporting is needed THEN the system SHALL provide outputs that can be referenced by other CloudFormation resources
4. WHEN state changes occur THEN the system SHALL include timestamps and operation context in audit logs
5. WHEN the operation completes THEN the system SHALL return a unique operation identifier for tracking purposes
